# TW-Plugins
This project consists of three plugins for TiddlyWiki:
- RTEditor
- TiddlyKanban
- GroupedTable

DoolPlex TW Plugins Demo.html file is a TiddlyWiki file with Stroll and contains the three plugins and demo data so that you can see the plugins in action

**RTEditor**
is a simple rich text editor with support of tab and shift-tab for indenting and outdenting. I use it to edit notes in view mode and the indenting and outdenting is supported since I use bullets a lot

**TiddlyKanban**
A simple wikitext macro providing a kanban board based on the parameters provided. It can be used in your tiddlywiki. I use it for managing the status of tasks and to assign tasks to people.

**GroupedTable**
This macro provides a table based on the filter parameter and groups the table based on teh provided field. I use it in combination with selector in the tiddler to easily change the grouping field and thus play with the dataset to get the right insight like taks linked to projects, task assigned to people or tasks grouped by status.
